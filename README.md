# Weather satellite radio project
During summer of 2020, when the state of the world was in lockdowm, I had come across a few videos which caught my eye. Talk of a way to grab and decode the data from a weather satellite, the NOAA satellites to be specific. Since I had always been quite interested in how the weather was monitored, and I had a love for astronomy I took it upon myself to try to decode even the smallest snippet of data from one of these satellites. Here I am after an entire year, if not more; finally with that small snippet of data to hand. 

## The crutial mistake and misunderstanding
After a small amount of research online I found out what I would need is an rtl-sdr and some kind of antenna to recieve the signal from the NOAA satellite, as well as some coaxial cable and a few connectors. An rtl-sdr is a very neat device which can be plugged into your computer and with the right software such as sdr sharp (sdr# for short), you would be able to listen to and monitor radio signals. For reference here is a list of what I bought to start with (these components are not the reason for the mistake made, that will be explained shortly):

- Bulleted [Nooelec rtl-sdr (I found the mini version to have connection problems so I recommend this version)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nooelec-NESDR-SMArt-SDR-R820T2-Based/dp/B01HA642SW/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=Rtl+SDR&qid=1638297518&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&smid=A1TIGMJ4AZ1K1A&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExR0xVWUhDRVdHNUlQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTU1NDM1MVJJQUZDQU8xRjJIOCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjMzNTg3M1RaU1QyWVJQTUxQVSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)

- Bulleted [Coaxial cable (I use 75 ohm but this 50 ohm is recommended)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/electrosmart-RG58-Black-Coaxial-Cable/dp/B01N5TR7OP/ref=sr_1_3?crid=CEK62CZO1H3H&keywords=50+ohm+coaxial+cable&qid=1638297676&sprefix=50+ohm+%2Caps%2C223&sr=8-3)
