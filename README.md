# Weather satellite radio project
During summer of 2020, when the state of the world was in lockdowm, I had come across a few videos which caught my eye. Talk of a way to grab and decode the data from a weather satellite, the NOAA satellites to be specific. Since I had always been quite interested in how the weather was monitored, and I had a love for astronomy I took it upon myself to try to decode even the smallest snippet of data from one of these satellites. Here I am after an entire year, if not more; finally with that small snippet of data to hand. 

## The crutial mistake and misunderstanding
After a small amount of research online I found out what I would need is an rtl-sdr and some kind of antenna to recieve the signal from the NOAA satellite, as well as some coaxial cable and a few connectors. An rtl-sdr is a very neat device which can be plugged into your computer and with the right software such as sdr sharp (sdr# for short), you would be able to listen to and monitor radio signals. For reference here is a list of what I bought to start with :
